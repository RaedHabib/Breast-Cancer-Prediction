## Project Description
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset to predict whether the cancer cells are benign or malignant. Utilizing data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this project integrates real-time patient data and explores the efficacy of new treatment options that were previously unavailable.

## Features
* Analysis of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
* Predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbors.
* Evaluation of model accuracy and generation of confusion matrices.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and ucimlrepo

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Original Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:<br>
